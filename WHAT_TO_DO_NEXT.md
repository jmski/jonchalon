- Deploy full Day 4 features
- Go live with everything
- Best experience

**If you have 5 minutes today**: Choose OPTION 1
- Deploy immediately
- Integrate later this week
- Still get everything live
- Lowest risk

**If you want to be careful**: Choose OPTION 3
- Deploy and test
- Integrate one feature at a time
- Monitor each change
- Most conservative

## ❓ QUICK Q&A

**Q: Will this break my site?**
A: No. Option 1 adds components but doesn't change existing pages. Option 2 only adds new animations (no breaking changes). Option 3 deploys first then integrates gradually.

**Q: Can I switch paths later?**
A: Yes! Deploy with Option 1, then integrate with Option 2 later.

**Q: What if something goes wrong?**
A: Use rollback: `git revert HEAD && git push origin main` (< 5 minutes to previous version)

**Q: When should I deploy?**
A: Anytime. The code is production-ready. Choose your preferred time.

**Q: Can I test locally first?**
A: Yes! Run `npm run dev` locally to see everything work before pushing.
