# Phase 2 — Schema Consumer Migration Summary

**Branch:** `phase-2-clean`
**Status:** ✅ tsc clean (consumers) · ✅ `npm run build` passes · ✅ `npm run dev` boots · ⚠️ Sanity dataset still on legacy shape (E-2 Phase 4 will migrate it)

This phase moved the codebase from "intentionally broken" (post-schema-deploy) back to "compiles and builds cleanly" against the new Sanity page singletons + shared singletons. No legacy schema files were deleted (E-2 owns that). No Sanity data was migrated. Pages render mostly empty until E-2 populates the new dataset.

## What changed

### lib/ (foundation rewrite — Step 1)
- **`lib/types.ts`** — full rewrite. New surface aligned to the new pageHome / pageAbout / pageContact / pageAudit / pageFoundation / pagePrograms / pageBlog / pageLessons / pageIkigai documents and the shared singletons (`siteConfig`, `newsletterCapture`, `auditCta`, `starterGuideCapture`, `pillarSet`, `fourCirclesSet`). Preserved: portal/ikigai/curriculum types that aren't part of the marketing schema migration.
- **`lib/sanity.ts`** — full rewrite. Added page fetchers (`getPageHome`, `getPageAbout`, `getPageContact`, `getPageAudit`, `getPageFoundation`, `getPagePrograms`, `getPageBlog`, `getPageLessons`, `getPageIkigai`) and shared singleton fetchers (`getNewsletterCapture`, `getAuditCta`, `getStarterGuideCapture`, `getPillarSet`, `getFourCirclesSet`, `getSiteConfig`). All deletions documented in session notes; preserved fetchers documented there as well.

### Layout + page consumers (Steps 2–4)
- **`app/(marketing)/layout.tsx`** — fetches `getSiteConfig` + `getNewsletterCapture`, propagates to `<SiteFooter>`.
- **`app/(marketing)/page.tsx` (Home)** — uses `getPageHome` + `getSiteConfig` + `getTestimonials` + `getRecentBlogPosts`. Sections: Hero → Method → FourPillars → AuditCTA → MeetJon → Testimonials → BlogCards → StarterGuideForm → EmailCapture (newsletter).
- **`app/(marketing)/about/page.tsx`** — `getPageAbout`. Sections: StoryScroll(beats[]) → WhoFor → CTA. AboutBento + AboutHero usage removed.
- **`app/(marketing)/contact/{page,ContactClient}.tsx`** — `getPageContact`. Inquiry cards drive type selector; `whatHappensNext`, `thingsWorthKnowing`, `emailFallback` come from CMS. Calendly + audit-prompt + coachingPath blocks deleted (see Known gaps).
- **`app/(marketing)/audit/{page,AuditClient}.tsx`** — `getPageAudit` + `getSiteConfig`. `'capture'` step deleted; quiz → result direct. `scoreToKey()` maps legacy `getBand()` (`foundation`/`developing`/`refining`) → new band keys (`low`/`mid`/`high`). Result band CTAs come from `band.primaryCta` / `band.secondaryCta`. Mid-quiz encouragement renders at midpoint. `<StarterGuideForm>` rendered on result.
- **`app/(marketing)/foundation/page.tsx`** — `getPageFoundation` + `getSiteConfig`. Sections: Hero (with whoFor right column) → WhyDance → Curriculum → HowItWorks → Enrollment (`<EnrollButton>` tier derived from `card.title.includes('check')`) → FAQ → SoftCta → StarterGuideForm. All `FALLBACK_*` arrays removed.
- **`app/(marketing)/programs/page.tsx`** — `getPagePrograms` + `getSiteConfig`. `heroWhoForColumn`, `caseStudiesHeader`, optional `programCardsHeader`, inlined `programCards[]` markup, `closingCta:CtaBlock`, FAQ from `faqItems`, StarterGuideForm.
- **`app/(marketing)/blog/{page,BlogClient}.tsx`** — `getPageBlog` + `getSiteConfig` (replaces `getEmailOptIn` + `getBlogConfig`). Hero/newsletter/emptyState/initialPillar/seriesBanner passed to BlogClient.
- **`app/(marketing)/ikigai/page.tsx`** — `getPageIkigai` + `getSiteConfig`. Renders `<IkigaiClient/>` then conditional `<StarterGuideForm/>` from `pageIkigai.starterGuide`.

### Components

Created:
- **`components/forms/StarterGuideForm.tsx`** — `'use client'` shared component used on home, ikigai, audit (result), foundation, programs. Props `{ guide: StarterGuideCapture | null, successMessage?: string }`. Submit handler is a TODO/`console.log` placeholder — no `/api/starter-guide` endpoint exists yet.
- **`components/sections/home/method/Method.tsx` (+ index.ts)** — replaces `WhyItWorks`. Consumes `MethodStep[]` + optional `SectionHeader`.

Modified (prop shape changes — see session notes for fields):
- `components/navigation/SiteFooter.tsx` — accepts `{siteConfig, newsletter}`.
- `components/forms/BlogOptIn.tsx` — `optIn:EmailOptInContent` → `newsletter:NewsletterCapture` + `successMessage`.
- `components/sections/home/four-pillars/FourPillars.tsx` — `{header?, pillars?:PillarCard[]}`.
- `components/sections/home/meet-jon/MeetJon.tsx` — `{header?, image?, bodyParagraphs[], primaryLink?, secondaryLink?}`.
- `components/sections/home/email-capture/EmailCapture.tsx` — `{newsletter?, successMessage?}`.
- `components/sections/about/story-scroll/StoryScroll.tsx` — single `{beats?:StoryBeat[]}` prop.
- `components/sections/about/who-for/WhoFor.tsx` — `{image?, headline, body}`.
- `components/sections/about/origin/Origin.tsx` — local `OriginPhase` interface (the lib type was removed; component is currently orphaned, retained for potential reuse).
- `components/shared/series-banner/SeriesBanner.tsx` — `{featuredSeries?:FeaturedSeries|null}`. Field rename `seriesCTALabel` → `seriesCtaLabel`.

Deleted (orphan after consumer rewrite):
- `components/sections/about/bento/`
- `components/sections/home/credibility-strip/`
- `components/sections/home/why-it-works/`
- `components/sections/home/cta/HomeCTA.tsx`
- `components/shared/press-strip/`
- `components/utilities/cards/ProgramTrackCard.tsx`

Barrel updates: `components/sections/index.ts` (added `Method`, removed `CredibilityStrip` / `WhyItWorks` / `AboutBento` / `HomeCTA`), `components/utilities/cards/index.ts` (removed `ProgramTrackCard`).

### Sanity studio (preserved as-is)
- `sanity/structure.ts`, `sanity/schemas/documents/pages/{pageBlog,pageHome,pagePrograms}.ts`, and `sanity/schemas/documents/shared/siteConfig.ts` carry forward the schema additions made during the schema-deploy commit (`featuredSeries`, `meetJonImage`, `programCardsHeader`, `socialLinks`, `contactEmail`).
- `tsconfig.json` `exclude` array gained `"sanity"` because the studio has its own `sanity/tsconfig.json` and pre-existing TS errors there (unrelated `__experimental_actions` removal in newer Sanity types, `media: unknown` preview returns) would otherwise block `next build`. Verified pre-existing on `e71d08c` via `git stash`.

## Triage of edge cases (from migration-inventory)

1. ✅ `HomeCTA` deleted — `pageHome` has no terminal CTA (auditCta + starterGuide replace).
2. ✅ `CredibilityStrip` / `WhyItWorks` / `AboutBento` deleted — no schema field.
3. ✅ `ProgramTrackCard` deleted — `programCards[]` shape doesn't match; programs page inlines markup.
4. ✅ `PressStrip` deleted — not referenced by any page; press mentions moved to legacy in studio.
5. ✅ Audit `'capture'` stage deleted — email collection no longer at end of audit.
6. ✅ Calendly + coachingPath deleted from contact (see Known gaps).
7. ✅ Foundation `FALLBACK_*` arrays deleted.
8. ✅ Programs `PROGRAMS_FAQS` hardcoded array deleted.
9. ✅ Blog `EmailOptInContent` + `BlogConfig` → `NewsletterCapture` + `pageBlog`.
10. ✅ Footer drives socials from `siteConfig.socialLinks[]`.
11. ✅ `OriginPhase` removed from lib/types — Origin component (orphaned) retains a local type.
12. ✅ `StoryBeat.anchorWord` not in new schema — dropped (renderHeadline anchor logic untouched).
13. ✅ `AboutWhoFor.highlight` not in new schema — dropped.

## Known issues / follow-up work

### Build
- **Home Hero spread bug fixed.** `components/sections/home/hero/Hero.tsx` previously merged props with `{ ...DEFAULTS, ...props }` — when Sanity returned `undefined` for unset hero fields, the spread overwrote defaults, producing `<Link href={undefined}>` and a `formatUrl` crash during static prerender (`Cannot destructure property 'auth' of 'a' as it is undefined`). Now uses per-field `??` fallback. Audited codebase for `{ ...DEFAULTS, ...props }` spread pattern with Sanity data; `Hero.tsx` was the only instance.

### Backend gaps (out of scope per directive)
- **No `/api/starter-guide` endpoint.** `StarterGuideForm.handleSubmit` is a `console.log` placeholder. Wire to `useFormSubmission` once the endpoint lands.
- **`/api/subscribe` (newsletter)** exists and accepts `{ firstName, email }` — compatible with current callers.

### Content gaps vs canonical-copy.md

Audited four pages against `design/canonical-copy.md`:

**Home (canonical §1–§10)**
- Section order mismatch. Canonical: Hero → Method → Pillars → Meet Jon → Testimonials → Blog → **Newsletter → Audit CTA → Starter Guide**. Actual: Hero → Method → Pillars → **Audit CTA** → Meet Jon → Testimonials → Blog → **Starter Guide → Newsletter**. The Audit CTA should be near the bottom (§9), not between Pillars and Meet Jon. Newsletter (§8) precedes Audit CTA + Starter Guide in canon, not vice versa.
- Meet Jon secondary link is canonically `null` (was "Watch Jon dance", deleted in phase 4). Schema field is still wired — must be left empty in CMS.

**Contact (canonical §1–§5)**
- **§1 audit-first hero card not rendered.** Canonical specifies a hero *card* with eyebrow `START HERE`, headline "*Not sure where to start?*", body, stats grid (7 questions / 3 minutes / 1 honest reply), primary CTA `Take the Presence Audit` → `/audit`, microcopy "*No account needed. Free.*". Current page renders a plain `<header className="contact-hero">` with eyebrow/headline/subhead only — no card layout, no stats grid, no CTA, no microcopy. Likely missing schema fields on `pageContact.hero` (CTA + microcopy + stats).
- **§2 divider line "*or reach out directly*" not rendered.** Was deleted alongside the Calendly block.
- **§2 section header "*What's on your mind?*"** is currently hardcoded in JSX, not driven by Sanity. Acceptable for now but should move to schema.

**Audit (canonical §1–§3)**
- **§1 hero / pre-quiz intro stage not rendered.** Canonical specifies a pre-quiz hero with `THE PRESENCE AUDIT` eyebrow, headline "*Seven questions. Three minutes. One honest read.*", subhead, microcopy "*Free. No account. No email required to see your result.*", and primary CTA `Start the Audit`. Current `useMultiStep` is `['quiz', 'result']` — quiz starts immediately on mount with no intro. Add a `'hero'` step before `'quiz'` and gate quiz entry on a CTA click.
- §2 mid-quiz encouragement and §3 result bands match canon.

**Foundation (canonical §1–§9)**
- ✅ Section order matches: Hero (with WhoFor right column) → Why Dance → Curriculum → How It Works → Enrollment → FAQ → Soft CTA → Starter Guide.
- §3 Why Dance third paragraph is the "lock paragraph" — verify in CMS that `whyDanceBodyParagraphs[]` has all three paragraphs populated.

### CSS polish (deferred)
New BEM classes are used without backing styles in the system CSS files. They render as semantic markup with no styling and need entries added during the polish pass:
- `contact-hero` / `contact-hero-headline` / `-subhead` / `-eyebrow`
- `audit-mid-encouragement`, `audit-result-starter-guide`
- `foundation-why-dance` / `-prose` / `-paragraph`, `foundation-pricing-eyebrow`
- `program-track-card-badge`
- `blog-page-eyebrow`, `blog-no-results-headline`, `blog-empty-headline`
- `starter-guide-form` / `-fields` / `-row`, `starter-guide-input`
- `home-starter-guide` / `-eyebrow` / `-headline` / `-body`
- `about-who-for-image`, `story-scroll-payoff`
- `jc-footer-contact`, `meet-jon-link--secondary`

### Sanity TS errors (pre-existing, excluded)
- `sanity/schemas/**` has TS errors against newer Sanity types (`__experimental_actions` removal, `media: unknown` from `prepare()`). These predate this branch and live in the studio sub-package, which has its own `tsconfig.json`. Excluded from root TS via `tsconfig.json` `exclude: ["sanity"]`.

### Tests
- No test scripts in `package.json` (`scripts.test` absent). No tests were run.

## Ready for E-2

Yes. The codebase compiles and builds against the new schema. Pages will render with mostly empty content until the dataset is migrated — that's the expected Phase 2 end state. E-2 Phase 4 owns deleting the legacy schema files and the legacy data migration script.
