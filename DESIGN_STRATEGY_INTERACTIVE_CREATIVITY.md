# 🎨 Design Evolution Strategy: Artistic Interactivity

**Inspiration Sources**: BTS (tech-forward elegance) + Breakdancing (urban energy) + Bruno Mars (retro-funk) + Michael Jackson (iconic presence)

---

## 🎭 Current State Analysis

**Your Current Strengths:**
- ✅ Dark theme is excellent foundation
- ✅ Good component library already in place (AnimatedCounter, CardTilt, GlitchText, etc.)
- ✅ Warm gold/coral palette is sophisticated
- ✅ Performance-optimized (88/100 Lighthouse)

**Opportunity Areas:**
- ⚠️ Color scheme could be bolder and more energetic
- ⚠️ Interactivity is present but not *showcased* prominently
- ⚠️ Missing rhythm/music-inspired visual language
- ⚠️ No 3D perspective elements yet
- ⚠️ Animations feel separated from content, not integrated

```

**Where**: Background, video sections, CTA areas

---

### **8. Live Performance Mode**
```tsx
