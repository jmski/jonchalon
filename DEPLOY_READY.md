## 🎬 Your Story is Now Front & Center

Your about page now tells your powerful narrative:

> **From Clarinet to Karate to Dance**  
> You grew up between disciplines. Music training, martial arts mastery, and then dance—where you competed internationally. A 10-year break for career. Now reigniting that fire with family as inspiration, building a dance program and creating authentic content.

This is **compelling**. This differentiates you from 1000s of generic creator sites.
